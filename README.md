### Client Application
Part 2 of this project was written in React and styled using Bootstrap. It makes use of both React class and functional components. The class components are used when component's lifecycle methods are needed, while the functional components are used to make use of React Hooks. React Context is use to share and persist global state about user's authorization status and reading list.
